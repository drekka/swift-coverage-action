# Swift Coverage report action

This action must be run after a `swift build --enable-code-coverage â€¦` action. It gathers the coverage data generated by the unit testing and fails the build if any file's coverage is below the minimum required. By default, 80%. 

When coverage fails a report is appended to the build summary listing the files that failed so developers can address the issue. The files are also linked to the sources in the relevant branch in the GitHub repo.

# Usage

Minimal usage:

```yaml
- run swift test --enable-code-coverage
- uses: drekka/swift-coverage-action@v1.4
```

Available arguments. All of these are optional and listed here with their default values.

```yaml
- run swift test --enable-code-coverage
- uses: drekka/swift-coverage-action@v1.4
  with:
    # The minimum percentage of coverage each source file
    # should met for the action to be successful.
    coverage: 80

    # Display all sources files. 
    # By default this action only reports the files that fail 
    # to met the minimum coverage.
    show-all-files: false
    
    # By default the report is sorted by coverage percentage
    # then file name where percentages are the same.
    # Enabling this flag sorts the report by file name
    # which is useful when there are many files in the list.
    sort-by-name: false        

    # The Swift build directory.
    # This should match the Swift compilers --scratch-path argument.
    # The folder is searched for the JSON code coverage files.
    build-dir: .build

    # Glob used within the build-dir to locate the 
    # code coverage JSON files.
    coverage-files: **/codecov/*.json
        
    # Comma list of globs which define the source
    # files we want coverage for. 
    # Generally these should match the folders where
    # the sources for your project reside.
    includes: **/Sources/**
        
    # Comma list of globs which define source
    # files we want to exclude from coverage reporting. 
    # When filtering the files to report on, 
    # includes are processed first, then excludes.
    includes: 
```
